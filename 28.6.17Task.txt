Q1.Write a note on covariant return type with example code.

Ans.	The covariant return type in java, allows narrowing down return type of the 
	overridden method. This feature will help to avoid down casting on the client 
	side. It allows programmer to program without the need of type checking and down 
	casting. The covariant return type always works only for non-primitive return types.

class A{  
A get(){return this;}  
}  
  
class B1 extends A{  
B1 get(){return this;}  
void message(){System.out.println("welcome to covariant return type");}  
  
public static void main(String args[]){  
new B1().get().message();  
}  
}  





Q2.Write a note on Enum with example code.

Ans.	Enum in java is a data type that contains fixed set of constants.
	It can be used for days of the week (SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, 
	FRIDAY and SATURDAY) , directions (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST and WEST) etc. The java enum
	constants are static and final implicitly. It is available from JDK 1.5.
	
	Java Enums can be thought of as classes that have fixed set of constants.

Points to remember for Java Enum:-

1.enum improves type safety
2.enum can be easily used in switch
3.enum can be traversed
4.enum can have fields, constructors and methods
5.enum may implement many interfaces but cannot extend any class because it internally 
  extends Enum class

class EnumExample1
{  
public enum Season { WINTER, SPRING, SUMMER, FALL }  
  
public static void main(String[] args) 
{  
for (Season s : Season.values())  
System.out.println(s);  
  
}
}  



Q3.Write a note on use of super keyword and super() method.

Ans.	The super keyword in java is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate 
	parent class object. Whenever you create the instance of subclass, an instance of 
	parent class is created implicitly which is referred by super reference variable.
	Usage of java super Keyword

USAGE OF JAVA SUPER KEYWORD:- 	

1.	super can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.

2.	super can be used to invoke immediate parent class method.
	
3.	super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.

	
1) super is used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.

	We can use super keyword to access the data member or field of parent class. 
	It is used if parent class and child class have same fields.

2) super can be used to invoke parent class method

	The super keyword can also be used to invoke parent class method.
 	It should be used if subclass contains the same method as parent class. 
	In other words, it is used if method is overridden.

3) super is used to invoke parent class constructor.

The super keyword can also be used to invoke the parent class constructor.




Q4.Write a code to implement abstraction using interface.

Ans.	

interface A
{  
void a();  
void b();  
void c();  
void d();  
}  
  
abstract class B implements A
{  
public void c(){System.out.println("I am C");
}  
}  
  
class M extends B
{  
public void a(){System.out.println("I am a");}  
public void b(){System.out.println("I am b");}  
public void d(){System.out.println("I am d");}  
}  
  
class Test5
{  
public static void main(String args[])
{  
A a=new M();  
a.a();  
a.b();  
a.c();  
a.d();  
}
}
