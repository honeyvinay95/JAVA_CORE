Q1.Explain regular expression and quantifiers with example code

	
	Ans. 	Regular Expression:
		-------------------
	The Java Regex or Regular Expression is an API to define pattern for searching or 

	manipulating strings. It is widely used to define constraint on strings such as 

	password and email validation. Java Regex API provides 1 interface and 3 classes in 

	java.util.regex package. The Matcher and Pattern classes are widely used in 
	
	java regular expression.


import java.util.regex.*;  
class RegexExample2{  
public static void main(String args[]){  
System.out.println(Pattern.matches(".s", "as"));  
System.out.println(Pattern.matches(".s", "mc"));  
System.out.println(Pattern.matches(".s", "mst"));  
System.out.println(Pattern.matches(".s", "avps"));  
System.out.println(Pattern.matches("..s", "mas"));  
}}  
	
	quantifiers:
	-------------
	The quantifiers specify the number of occurrences of a character.
	

import java.util.*;
  
class Test
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
 
        Pattern p = Pattern.compile("g+");
  
         Matcher m = p.matcher("ggg");
  
        while (m.find())
            System.out.println("Pattern found from " + m.start() +
                               " to " + (m.end()-1));
  
    }
}





Q2.Explain DAO design pattern with example

	
	Ans.	This is a design pattern used to create classes and interfaces in such a way so that the client
		can easily interact with the data of DataBase without knowing the internal structure used to
		connect with the DataBase and fetch the data.







Q3.Write a note on how DAO helps in abstraction


	Ans.	The DataAccessObject is the primary object of this pattern. The DataAccessObject 
		
		abstracts the underlying data access implementation for the BusinessObject to
		
		enable transparent access to the data source. The BusinessObject also delegates 
		
		data load and store operations to the DataAccessObject.	



Q4.Describe the different approaches of String processing.


	Ans.	Character class:
		----------------
		In the context of regular expressions, a character class is a set of characters enclosed 
		within square brackets. It specifies the characters that will successfully match a single 
		character from a given input string.


		Matcher class:
		-------------
		It implements MatchResult interface. It is a regex engine i.e. used to perform match
		operations on a character sequence.
	
	
		Pattern class:
		-------------
		It is the compiled version of a regular expression. It is used to define a pattern 
		for the regex engine.	


		Predefined Character class:
		---------------------------
		any lowercase letter, any uppercase letter, the underscore character, or any digit.
		Use the predefined classes whenever possible. They make your code easier to read 
		and eliminate errors introduced by malformed character classes.
		
		for Ex:- \d means a range of digits (0-9), and \w means a word character.


		quantifiers:
		-------------
		Quantifiers allow you to specify the number of occurrences to match against. For 
		convenience, the three sections of the Pattern API specification describing greedy, reluctant,
		At first glance it may appear that the quantifiers X?, X?? and X?+ do exactly the same thing, 
		since they all promise to match "X, once or not at all". There are subtle implementation differences 
		

		Greedy Quantifires:
		-------------------
		The greedy quantifier .* to find "anything", zero or more times,followed by the letters "f" "o" "o". 
		Because the quantifier is greedy, the .* portion of the expression first eats the entire input string.
		At this point, the overall expression cannot succeed, because the last three letters ("f" "o" "o") have 
		already been consumed. So the matcher slowly backs off one letter at a time until the rightmost occurrence 
		of "foo" has been regurgitated, at which point the match succeeds and the search ends.
