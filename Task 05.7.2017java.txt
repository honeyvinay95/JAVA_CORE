Q1.Write a note on PreparedStatement and ResultSetMetaData interfaces with code snippets.


	Ans. 	
	
	The PreparedStatement interface is a subinterface of Statement. It is used to execute parameterized query.
	Let's see the example of parameterized query:
	String sql="insert into emp values(?,?,?)";  
	As you can see, we are passing parameter (?) for the values. 
	Its value will be set by calling the setter methods of PreparedStatement.
	ResultSetMetaData Interface

	The metadata means data about data i.e. we can get further information from the data.

	If you have to get metadata of a table like total number of column, column name, column type etc.
 	ResultSetMetaData interface is useful because it provides methods to get metadata from the ResultSet object.

Q2.Write a note on DDL, DML, DQL, DDL with code snippets.

	Ans.

	DDL:
	---
	
	Data Definition Language (DDL) statements are used to define the database structure or schema. Some examples:
	CREATE - to create objects in the database
	ALTER - alters the structure of the database
	DROP - delete objects from the database
	TRUNCATE - remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed
	COMMENT - add comments to the data dictionary
	RENAME - rename an object
	

	DML
	---
	Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements are used for managing data within schema objects. Some examples:
	SELECT - retrieve data from the a database
	INSERT - insert data into a table
	UPDATE - updates existing data within a table
	DELETE - deletes all records from a table, the space for the records remain
	MERGE - UPSERT operation (insert or update)
	CALL - call a PL/SQL or Java subprogram
	EXPLAIN PLAN - explain access path to data
	LOCK TABLE - control concurrency
	
	
	DCL:
	---

	Data Control Language (DCL) statements. Some examples:
	GRANT - gives user's access privileges to database
	REVOKE - withdraw access privileges given with the GRANT command

	(  
	ID int identity primary key,  
	Name varchar(50),
